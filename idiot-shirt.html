    <p>This shirt was inspired by my friend ethan.</p><br>
    <p>Although the cause of death was reported as accident - fall from height, Richard, a 88-year-old former CEO, is convinced that his ex-boyfriend, Maximillian Rose, was murdered.

He is an Argentinian Hindu who defines himself as pansexual. He has a post-graduate degree in business studies.

Physically, Richard is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with bronze skin, blonde hair and green eyes.

He grew up in an upper class neighbourhood. His father left when he was young, leaving him with his mother, who was an addict.

He is currently in a relationship with Samuel Jessie Price. Samuel is the same age as him and works as a plumber.

Richard has one child with boyfriend Samuel: Joann aged 40.

Richard's best friend is a former CEO called Virgil Davis. They get on well most of the time. He also hangs around with a former CEO called Ellis Howard. They enjoy looking for clues together.
